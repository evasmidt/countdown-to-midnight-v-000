#Write a method that takes in an integer argument and uses a while loop
#to countdown from that integer to 0, outputting "#{number} SECOND(S)!"
#in each iteration of the loop. The method should return "HAPPY NEW YEAR!"
#after the loop finishes.
#Hint: In Ruby, a method will return the very last line of code that it executes.

#x = 1
#while x < 10
#  puts "#{x} is less than 10"
#  x += 1
#end
